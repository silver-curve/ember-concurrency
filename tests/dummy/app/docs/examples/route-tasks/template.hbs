<h3>Tasks on Ember.Route (and other long-lived objects)</h3>

<p>
  <strong>ember-concurrency</strong> tasks are scoped to the lifetime of
  the object they live on, so if that object is destroyed, all of the
  tasks attached to it are canceled.  This is very convenient when
  writing tasks on object with finite lifetimes, like Components, but certain Ember objects, like
  Routes (and Controllers), are never actually destroyed. Even
  if you can't rely on object destruction to cancel a task,
  <strong>ember-concurrency</strong> makes it easy to run
  tasks between lifecycle events other than <code>init</code>
  and <code>destroy</code>.
</p>

<h3>Live Example</h3>

<p>
  Try clicking the links below. As the URL changes, you should see
  notifications about the server polling status changing. If you
  leave this route (by going to another page on this site), you'll
  see that the polling task is being properly canceled.
</p>

<ul>
  {{#each ids as |id|}}
  <li>
    {{#link-to 'docs.examples.route-tasks.detail' id}}
      Thing {{id}}
    {{/link-to}}
  </li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    We use the <a href="https://github.com/aexmachina/ember-notify">ember-notify</a> Ember Addon
    to display notifications using the <code>notify</code> service it provides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>setupController</code> kicks off the task with the current model id
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>pollServerForChanges</code> task polls the server in a loop,
    and uses the <code>finally</code> block to notify when it is being canceled.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use <code>restartable</code> to ensure that only one instance of the
    task is running at a time, hence any time <code>setupController</code>
    performs the task, any prior instances are canceled.
  </li>
  <li>
    We use <code>.cancelOn('deactivate')</code> to make sure the task cancels
    when the user leaves the route.
  </li>
</ul>
